Generate a dataset ready for data science from AMZScout without paying a dime.

And itâ€™s further described in this paragraph.
[See the docs ðŸ“š](https://amzscout-scrape.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more info.

# About

This uses undetected chromedriver and the [AMZScout extension `njopapoodmifmcogpingplfphojnfeea`](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amazon-product-finder-amz/njopapoodmifmcogpingplfphojnfeea?utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=amzscout_wa&utm_campaign=topbanner?utm_source=webapp) to extract information from Amazon product pages.

# Using

## Dependencies

### Chrome or Chromium

#### Windows

```bash
winget install --id Google.Chrome
```

#### Ubuntu & Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get install chromium-browser
```

#### MacOS & Other

Download [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/) like anywhere else

### `chromedriver`

Make sure you install `chromedriver` on your system alongside a recent version of Chrome or Chromium.

#### brew (macOS only)

```bash
brew install chromedriver
```

#### Scoop (Windows)

Note: scoop only has chromedriver for win32 platforms. If you're on a 64-bit system, your mileage may vary.

```bash
scoop install chromedriver
```

#### Other platforms

Refer to https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/downloads?authuser=0 for instructions downloading chromedriver on your respective system.

### poetry

With a good version of Python installed, run the following:

```bash
pip install pipx
pipx install poetry
```

If you get a memo about it not being on your path, Google will be your best friend.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/regulad/amzscout-scrape.git
cd amzscout-scrape
poetry install
```

## Usage

Usage is about as simple as it gets.

```bash
poetry run amzscout-scrape --help
```

It will keep you updated, although it will take a hot minute.

Once it's done, you'll have a CSV file in the current directory.

## Proxy

Included is a simple Tailscale configuration that serves a SOCKS5 proxy on your local machine.

Copy the contents of `proxy.env-example` into `.env`, populate the fields and then perform the following command on a machine that has docker installed:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then, you can use the `--proxy` flag to use the proxy.

```bash
poetry run amzscout-scrape --proxy socks5://localhost:1055
```
